# This file defines the content of the navbar.
# There are two ways to define a menu-item:
#
# 1. (Compare with 2-L-functions below)
#   Here, a menu item consists of
#   - a heading, which in turn contains a title, which can be a link, and
#   - a list of parts of the dropdown menu, where each part is either
#     - a text or link, or 
#     - a "link-bar", which consists of
#       - a title, which can be a link, and
#       - a list of entries, each of which are text or links.
#
# 2. (Compare with 3-Modular-forms below)
#   Here, menu item consists of
#   - a heading (as in (1))
#   - a list of groups, each of which consists of 
#     - a title (which can be a link), and
#     - a list of parts (as in (1))
#
# In the end, (1) is a just special case of (2),
# if one wraps the parts into one group with title "".
#
#
# Essentially everything (menu-items, headings, groups, parts, entries)
# can have the following attributes:
#
# - status, with values:
#   - beta 
#   - future
#   This changes the css-layout and can also hide elements.
#   Children inherit the status attribute unless they overwrite the status.
#
# - requires, with values:
#   - beta
#   - not_beta
#   - auth_or_beta
#   - auth_and_beta
#   - auth
#   - not-auth
#   An element and it children will be only shown 
#   if the required condition is met.
#
# - css_classes (strings separated by " ")
#   They will be added to the html-tags in the "classes" attribute.
#   The status is automatically added to the css_classes.
#   
# Currently, if status is beta or future, we automatically require beta
# for the menu-entry to be shown.
